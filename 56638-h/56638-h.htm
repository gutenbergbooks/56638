<p>The purpose of this work is to assist students of grenade work in
acquiring a rapid and complete knowledge of the subject. If the student
will refer constantly to the illustrations, which are accurate drawings
of grenades now in use, this book may help to elucidate many points
which are inadequately treated in any existing work.</p>

<p>In compiling the book, the author has inserted only information
absolutely necessary, and has arranged it so simply that a person with
a very little previous knowledge of the subject may be able to grasp
both the data given, and the principles, and methods herein explained
and illustrated.</p>

<p>This book is the result of practical experience in the present war.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>HAND GRENADES</h2></div>

<p>A grenade is a hollow ball, cylinder, or cube, made of metal or other
material, which is filled with some explosive, and burst by means of a
fuse, or on impact when it falls among an enemy. Until about the end
of the seventeenth century trained soldiers called Grenadiers used
grenades which were thrown by hand, but after that date they fell into
disuse. In 1899—1900 at the siege of Mafeking they are said to have
been used by the besieged, and also in the Russo-Japanese war. In the
year 1914, however, the beginning of the great war produced new methods
in the employment of infantry in the attack or defense of positions.
It was proved that under many conditions infantry armed only with a
rifle and bayonet found it impossible to press home an attack or hold a
position against troops armed with grenades.</p>

<p>This weapon, handy to use and immensely destructive and demoralizing in
its employment, has played a most important part in every successful
operation carried out by British troops on the Western front. It has
become one of the principal weapons not only in trench warfare, but in
the attack and clearing of enemy positions, strong points, villages,
and especially in house-to-house and cellar fighting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> 1. In throwing all hand grenades an
overarm action will be used, like a bowler when playing cricket.</p>

<p>2. Attached to all stick hand grenades are tapes or streamers a couple
of feet long to enable them to fly head first, when thrown.</p>

<p><b>Duties of Above.</b> <i>Nos. 1 and 2 Bayonet Man.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Clearing of a
Trench to a Flank.</i> They are the bodyguard for the thrower and carrier
and must always protect them under any conditions and at all costs.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The latter are
not armed against attack at close quarters. The bayonet men work in
advance of the thrower and carrier of their squads. They act as trench
scouts; that is, they instruct their thrower and carrier how the trench
runs and where the dug-outs and side trenches will be met. They will
carry their rifles with bayonets fixed, loaded, magazine full. No. 3
and 6 bomb and clear all dug-outs on the way down the trench. The first
man throws the bomb, the bayonet man enters the dug-out and completes
its work. At the junctions of communication trenches and side trenches
they act as trench sentries and observers until relieved by the squads
in rear. If necessity arises they assist the thrower by throwing bombs.</p>

<p>2. <i>Frontal Attack against Enemy Positions.</i> They will be in line with,
not in advance of the thrower and carrier and will protect them while
throwing by snap shooting, or with their bayonets against assault, or a
sudden rush by the enemy when at close quarters.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Street Fighting and Village Cleaning.</i> They will keep down enemy
rifle fire by snap shooting, so as to enable the thrower to work close
enough to his objective to throw grenades, and when these have burst,
will go forward and complete their work.</p>

<p><i>No. 3. First Thrower.</i> He throws grenades according to the directions
given him by his leader or by his bayonet men. He is a picked man,
steady under fire and chosen for his accuracy and length in throwing.</p>

<p><i>No. 4. The Carrier.</i> He follows close enough in rear of the throwers
to keep them supplied with grenades, but must be careful not to crowd
them or impede the throwing. He will be prepared to instantly take up
the duties of the thrower should he become a casualty.</p>

<p><i>No. 5. N.C.O. or Leader.</i> He is responsible for his squad and the
proper carrying out of the duties given to the squad. He will inspect
each man before an attack and see that he has his complete equipment
and that he knows the general idea and direction of the attack and
the final objective of his squad. He will be responsible for the
maintenance of supplies of grenades through his squad to the thrower,
and will supervise the automatic filling up of casualties in his squad
by men from the squads in the rear. He will indicate the position and
progress of his squad in the attack to supporting troops, etc., by
means of flags or other signals by day and by colored flares by night.</p>

<p><i>Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9.</i> Their duties are the same as Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4,
and are to be considered primarily as carriers until otherwise employed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>No. 10. Spare Man.</i> He will act, if necessity arises, as leader of his
section, to clear side trenches, etc., and will instantly take over the
duties of No. 5 should he become a casualty.</p>

<p><i>No. 11. Sniper.</i> He will act as a sniper by day and a connecting file
by night, between his own squad and the squad of troops in rear.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> <span class="smcap">Note.</span> Every man in the
grenade squad should be trained to fill the position of any other in
the squad. </p>

<p><b>Explanation of Chart No. A2.</b> The position occupied by grenadiers
in an attacking squad has this main point in consideration.</p>

<p>The safety and local protection of each individual in the squad; care
should be taken that as far as possible each man has a solid corner of
the trench close to him, which he can use as a protection against the
bursting effect of enemy grenades, by quickly advancing or retiring
around the corner.</p>

<p>The bayonet men are in advance of the thrower, close enough to protect
him, and not too far in front as to be in danger of being bombed by him.</p>

<p>The thrower—the actual means of attack—is protected in front by the
traverse and in the rear by the corner of the parados. The carrier is
close behind the thrower and is protected by two corners. The N.C.O. or
leader is where he can best watch the flight of the grenades thrown by
the throwers, and is also equally well protected.</p>

<p><b>Method of Advance.</b> It is usually the endeavor to bomb and clear
three bays at a time in advance of the bayonet men. The N.C.O. reports
the throwing by the word “Mark,” to indicate a burst in the required
bay. On the third mark having been registered, the N.C.O. gives the
order, “Bayonet men report.” They immediately advance up the trench
to the last bay cleared and report back after examination either “All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
clear” or “Enemy holding,” whereupon the N.C.O. gives the order
“Advance,” or directs the thrower to bomb the last bay again. This
means of advance is continued until the objective is gained.</p>

<p><b>Island Traverse.</b> The two methods of attack are employed as shown
on the chart. It is imperative that the attack must not be allowed
to be held up, and should it be found impossible to advance down the
trench itself, owing to enfilade fire, the attack must be immediately
launched outside the trench, so as to attack the traverse from the
rear, in the case of a daylight attack.</p>

<p><b>Precautions.</b> Care must be taken, especially by the bayonet men
in their advance through the trench, that enemy concealed trenches,
dug-outs, etc., are not left undiscovered. The sides of trenches and
the walls and floors of dug-outs should be carefully examined for
concealed entrances or exits.</p>

<p><b>The Advance.</b></p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3"><b>1. In line with infantry.</b></li>
<li class="isub3"><b>2. In advance of infantry.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>No. 1 is the method adopted in daylight attack, the advance not being
covered by gas or smoke clouds.</p>

<p>No. 2 is method adopted in night attack and when weather conditions or
topographical features of ground covered in the advance allow it.</p>

<p>Attacking squads are allotted positions in lines of infantry
immediately opposite their first objectives, and on reaching these
positions should immediately commence bombing and clearing the trenches
towards their final objectives. In the case of No. 1 the infantry clears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the main trench, but special grenade parties may be told off to assist
the infantry in this work, especially when strong points occur in the
enemy position.</p>

<p>It is most important that all infantry taking part in an attack should
be previously supplied with grenades and this must be considered the
first source of supply. Positions designated as infantry grenade
dumping positions should be chosen and known to the infantry at which
they dump their grenades in their advance on the enemy positions. These
positions should be close to the position to be captured and held.</p>

<p>In order to hold positions captured from the enemy it is imperative
that grenade storming parties hold their final objectives at all costs,
and until the positions to be permanently held have been consolidated.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>TRENCH STORMING PARTIES</h2></div>

<p>Trench storming parties should kill or drive back the hostile occupants
of a trench as quickly as possible, clear as much of the enemy trench
as has been ordered, and then hold the portion cleared with as small
loss as possible to themselves. It must be remembered that in trench
clearing, and especially in deep and narrow trenches, only the head of
the attacking party can directly kill, and seldom more than one man
can throw at a time. Therefore it is essential that a constant supply
of grenades reaches the thrower and that the places of casualties are
automatically filled by reinforcements. Men must be trained until they
can do this either by day or at night time.</p>

<p><b>Advance.</b> Movement is rapid until contact with the enemy is
obtained. Once contact is established it must be maintained and
pressed home. A retreating enemy must be given no time to re-establish
a defensive attitude, corners must be worked carefully and bays and
straight pieces of trench rushed. The bayonet men will complete the
work of the grenades and see that the carrier and thrower will meet
with no opposition on their way to new throwing position. The effect of
a grenade bursting in a confined space like a trench is tremendous, and
though it may not kill it will stun or shock the hostile occupants, and
if the bayonet men follow up rapidly they will meet with very little
resistance.</p>

<p><b>Casualties.</b> Every man must be trained to take up the duties of
any other man in his squad. They do not necessarily keep to their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
squads; the squads in rear of the attacking squad may be looked on as
a reserve squad for the one in front. Thus, Casualty first squad. The
thrower No. 3 is reinforced by the first thrower of the second squad,
and so on.</p>

<p><b>Side Trenches.</b> When a side trench is met with, the leading squad
will go up and clear it. The second half will remain at the junction
until first returns, then the second squad will continue advance in
original direction of the attack.</p>

<p><b>Blocking and Barricades.</b> For blocking captured trenches, etc.,

<div class="chapter"><h2>EXPLOSIVES USED IN GRENADES</h2></div>

<p>Explosives are divided into two classes:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">1. Low explosives.</li>
<li class="isub3">2. High explosives.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the first group belong all propellant explosives, i.e., all powders,
such as gunpowder and smokeless powders used in firearms.</p>

<p>To the second group belong:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub4">(<i>a</i>) All explosives used in shells, torpedoes, grenades,</li>
<li class="isub6">demolitions, etc.</li>
<li class="isub4">(<i>b</i>) Detonators or exploders, i.e., explosives which start</li>
<li class="isub6">explosive reactions in the explosives of Group (<i>a</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The characteristic of H.E.</b> is the extreme violence and
suddenness of their detonation.</p>

<p>In order to make them instantly pass from a solid or liquid form to
gas, they require a detonator or exploder, which applies a violent
shock to them and breaks down the chemical structure of the explosive
compound, and enables the flame to pass instantaneously throughout the
mass of the compound. This explosive is known as detonation.</p>

<p><b>The composition of H.E.</b> almost without exception is some
organic substance, usually some form of carbon combined with nitrogen.
Nitrogen, one of the most inert gases known, owes its explosive value
to this very inertness; it combines so very reluctantly that on the
least provocation—such as shock—the compound of which it forms a part instantly
breaks up into gas, giving the enormous expansion needed for explosive effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Ammonal.</b> A gray powder. An Austrian explosive, picric acid plus
T.N.T. plus aluminum powder plus nitrate of ammonia plus carbon.</p>

<p>A very safe explosive—will not detonate when struck by rifle bullet,
but is very hygroscopic (collects moisture) and when in this condition
is liable not to detonate.</p>

<p><b>Ballistite.</b> Consists of guncotton plus camphor or vaseline.
Invented by Nobel in 1888.</p>

<p><b>Cordite.</b> Consists of nitro-glycerine 55 parts, plus guncotton 37
parts, plus vaseline 5 parts, plus acetone to harden, invented by Sir W. Abel.</p>

<p><b>Benzol.</b> Or Benzine, used extensively as a motor fuel contains a
fair percentage of toluene. (See T.N.T.)</p>

<p><b>Coal Tar.</b> When subjected to fractional and low-temperature
distillation produces many by-products valuable in the making of H.E.
These distillations give off “light” and “heavy” oils of coal tar.</p>

<p><b>Donnerite.</b> High explosive employed by German army in grenades.</p>

<p><b>Dynamite.</b> See Nitro-glycerine.</p>

<p><b>Fulminate of Mercury.</b> See Mercury.</p>

<p><b>Guncotton</b>, or nitro-cellulose consists of cotton waste,
purified, dried, and heated with mixture of concentrated nitric and
sulphuric acid. Washed and reduced to a pulp and moulded into 1 oz. primers

<b>Gunpowder.</b> A mechanical mixture.</p>

<p>Saltpeter 75 per cent, plus charcoal 15 per cent, plus sulphur 10 per
cent. Rate of burning depends upon firmness of powder.</p>

<p><b>Lyddite</b>, or picric acid. Consists of melted and solidified
picric acid. Vaseline is used to melt it. (See Picric Acid.)</p>

<p><b>Mercury Fulminate.</b> Is made by dissolving three parts mercury
in 36 parts nitric acid, keeping mixture at low temperature, and when
dissolved adding 17 parts of alcohol.</p>

<p>A small quantity of F. of M. placed on top of T.N.T. forms an excellent
detonating mixture. A great many German detonators consist of this.
Discovered by Howard in 1800.</p>

<p><b>Melinite.</b> A French H.E., very similar to lyddite. Is picric acid
mixed with collodion. Introduced by Eugene Turpin.</p>

<p><b>Nitro-glycerine.</b> Is produced by the action of nitric acid and
sulphuric acid on glycerine. Invented in 1847. When pure is a colorless
liquid. Explodes when heated to about 360° F.</p>

<p class="blockquot">N.G. in liquid form too dangerous to be used in
practice. Was absorbed in porous solid by Nobel in 1867 as dynamite.
Porous solid used either <b>kiesulguhr</b> or <b>fullers’ earth</b>
used in percussion caps.</p>

<p><b>Picric acid.</b> A yellow crystalline prepared from coal tar. A
by-product of gas manufacture. The “heavy oil” of coal tar is boiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and chemically treated, resulting in phenol or carbolic acid, which
separates from it. Carbolic acid is boiled sulphuric acid, and nitric
acid is carefully added, resulting in picric acid.</p>

<p>It is a very safe explosive and very powerful. Its chief fault is that
it forms “picrates” with metals or acid salts, some of which are more
sensitive to disturbing influences than the acid itself. To overcome
this the inside of all shells are varnished.</p>

<p>Pressure of picric acid equals 135,820 lb. on the square inch.</p>

<p><b>Shimose.</b> Japanese H.E. Similar to lyddite.</p>

<p><b>T.N.T.</b>, or tri-nitro-toluene or Toluol, largely used in German
army and navy. Is produced by heating toluene with mixture of nitric
and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Less powerful than lyddite, but is more stable and does not form
“picrates” and is not affected by water or air. Will not explode if hit
by a bullet.</p>

<p>Pressure T.N.T. equal to 119,000 lbs. per square inch.</p>

<p><b>Tolite.</b> French name for T.N.T.</p>

<p><b>Trilite.</b> Spanish name for T.N.T.</p>

<p><b>Trotyl.</b> German name for T.N.T.</p>

<p><b>Toluene</b>, or Toluol. Experiments made in 1899 at Karlsruhe
produced about seven pints of toluene from one ton of coal. The modern
process of low-temperature distillation of coal, however, greatly
increases quantity that can be obtained from each ton.</p>

<p>Is an aromatic colorless liquid hydrocarbon.</p>

<p><b>Turpinite.</b> French H.E. similar to Melinite.</p>

<p><b>Tetryl.</b> A coal tar product containing more nitrogen than T.N.T.
or lyddite. When mixed with a lead oxide it makes a less sensitive and
safer preparation than fulminate of mercury for detonators.</p>

<h3 class="space-above2">SERVICE FUSE</h3>
<p class="center"><b>No. 11 Safety or Time Fuse</b></p>

<p><b>Description.</b> Color, black. Smooth surface.</p>

<p><b>Time of Burning.</b> One foot in thirty seconds.</p>

<p><b>Composition.</b> Train of slow match inside a wrapping of hemp or
flax, covered by layer of gutta-percha, surrounded by binding of black
waterproof tape.</p>

<h3 class="space-above2">INSTANTANEOUS OR QUICK FUSE</h3>

<p>Color, red. Ribbed surface.</p>

<p><b>Time of Burning.</b> Eighty feet per second.</p>

<p><b>Composition.</b> Same as service fuse, except that it contains quick
match in place of slow match.</p>

<p><b>Caution.</b> Instantaneous fuse must never be stored alongside safety fuse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="space-above2">DETONATORS</h3>

<p class="center"><b>SERVICE</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>No. 8 Mark VII</b></p>

<p><b>Description.</b> Copper tube open at one end painted red, marked on
white label, No. 8. M.K. VII containing 32 grs. fulminate of mercury.</p>

<p class="center"><b>COMMERCIAL (Long)</b></p>
<p class="center"><b>COMMERCIAL (Short)</b></p>

<p><b>Description.</b> Copper tube, open one end, containing 25 grs. fulminate of mercury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="space-above2">EXPLODERS</h3>

<p class="center"><b>SERVICE</b></p>

<p><b>Guncotton.</b> One-oz. primer, 15-oz. slab. See Explosives, Guncotton.</p>

<p><b>No. 2 Detonator for Hand Grenade.</b> Consists of brass tube
(detonator holder) with flat screw head. The other end is fitted with a
cavity which carries N.G. percussion cap. A commercial detonator open
end toward the screw head is placed inside, its open end closed with a
wooden plug; the closed end is pierced with four flash holes to enable
flash from percussion cap to communicate with F. of M. in detonator. A
brass screw in head of detonator holder closes detonator tube.</p>

<p>This detonator has three screw threads.</p>

<p><b>No. 3 Detonator.</b> See description of No. 2. This detonator is ¼
in. longer than No. 2, and has two screw threads.</p>

<h3 class="space-above2">PATENT LIGHTERS</h3>

<p><b>Nobel Lighter.</b> (See Plates 8 and 9.) The lighter is made up of
two cardboard tubes, one fitting over the other; inside the end of the
larger tube is a small brass cap containing friction composition. At
the top of the smaller tube are two friction points. These points are
held about ¼ in. from the cap containing friction composition, by a
safety pin passing through both tubes. At the other end of the smaller
tube is a small copper band into which the fuse can be crimped. A
narrow band of waterproof tape with a loose end is glued around the
joint of the two tubes to keep out moisture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><b>To Assemble.</b> Insert fuse into lighter, fasten by crimping, and
insert other end of fuse into detonator. The joints at lighter and
detonator should be waxed to make it damp-proof and flash-proof.</p>

<p><b>Brock Lighter.</b> See Grenade Hand. Consists of a small cardboard
cup filled with friction composition, covered with waterproof paper.
The latter can be torn off by pulling a small tag which is left free.</p>

<p>Grenades with fuses are so arranged (with sufficient length of fuse)
to explode from 3 to 5 seconds after being ignited and thrown, giving
the thrower plenty of time (when throwing from a trench) to bend down
safe. Grenades, without fuses (but with detonators only) will explode
on impact; for instance, in Grenade No. 1, Mark I, it is obvious when
instructions (see p. 2, Grenade 1) are carried out, and grenade is thrown,
that the steel needle will be driven into the detonator and exploded.</p>

<p>In Grenade No. 3, Mark I, when safety pin is removed and releasing
socket slipped back, the wind vane revolves backward (during the
passage through the air) until far enough to allow the retaining
bolt to fall out. This leaves nothing between the firing needle and
detonator cap except a very thin spiral spring which is only strong
enough to hold the weight of the needle pellet until the shock of
impact when the grenade explodes.</p>

<p>In Grenade No. 20 releasing collar slips back on the rifle being fired.</p>

<p>In Grenade No. 5, Mark I. On this grenade being thrown the pressure
of the fingers being released the striking lever flies outward by the
pressure of the powerful spring, releasing the shoulder of the firing
striker which is driven on to the fuse and explodes in 4½ seconds.</p>

<p>All other grenades, see pages opposite plates.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>THROWING</h2></div>

<p>Hand grenades are held firmly in the hand behind the thrower, the arm
is brought quickly upward with a sweeping movement (the arm straight
all the time), the grenade will be let go when the hand is above the
thrower’s head, and should describe a semicircle in its flight.</p>

<p>Hand grenades can be thrown from 30 to 50 yards, rifle grenades from
200 to 400 yards.</p>

<p>Attacks should be practiced with dummy and deteriorated grenades, i.e.,
grenades with only a detonator and no explosive, etc.</p>

<p>Confidence and knowledge of grenades should be gained by students
handling, stripping and assembling all types and handling fuses and
detonators, as often as possible.</p>

<p>The importance of grenade work cannot be over-estimated and one
can imagine numberless cases when a grenade is more useful than any
other weapon. For instance, in street fighting a number of the enemy
are holding a house and firing from an upper window commanding the
main approach. You cannot get at them with a rifle, but it might be
comparatively easy for one or two men to get along to the house by back
ways, using the other houses for shelter and throw a grenade through
the window, killing everyone in the room.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
